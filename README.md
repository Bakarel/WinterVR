(May Change.) Project WinterVR

Engine: ogre next 2.4+

Objective: to become a Potential modular metaverse 2.0-3.0

General Idea: A small to medium built from the ground up (With plans of it becoming large if possible.) Social VR project similar to VR-Chat but for a smaller more mature audience and will embody the best of JanusVR and VR-Chat as well as second life and neos vr but without the drama and corruption vr chat has/had, Having both a means to surf the internet and a means to explore and create worlds and characters, Interactive experiences and then some. Also will have a starting splash screen saying which technologies were used to create it and have credits in the starting screen of possible contributes as time passes.

Design: WinterVR will have different categories of maps to enable people of low end to high end hardware to play, The first category being optimized/highly optimized maps, The second will be medium optimization for more demanding maps, The third one will be unoptimized for heavy maps with a lot of functionality and design fourth and last one will be heavily unoptimized for open large maps with 60 people in it to ensure people get the most out of wintervr at any point in time, From players to potential supporters to content creators to testers. Dedicated servers have a different architecture for security reasons.

Planed features.

1- text chat and voice chat.

2- Being able to use the internet from inside the game at some point.

3- 72 herz default refresh rate with up to 90 herz if wanted. (Future plans for 120 herz or higher.)

4- In game optimizations to the world and characters, Shaders and other optimizations to ensure optimum performance even if it costs some visual fidelity.

5- Hopefully larger more detailed worlds for richer immersion.

6- Dynamic world and object interaction.

7- 3D sound with Fmod.

8- Supporting all popular vr headsets via sdks.
9- A good, Intuitive VR-centric GUI. 

10- Android and IOS* support as well as windows mac and linux support. 

11- SteamVR, Vive and oculus integration if possible (With more headsets to be integrated.)

12- Open sourcing the client but keeping the master servers private (For security reasons.) but also having the ability for people to create private servers.

13- WinterVr SDK for Avatar creation, World creation, Shader creation and more.

14- The ability to play in offline mode or stand alone mode where you can explore the default 30 maps or more of the game and do things without needing a connection to the internet.

15- Support for full body tracking (11 trackers or more.) and functionality to take full advantage of it.

16- Modularity of the code and metaverse making it able to be upgraded by me and the community.

17- Complex and dynamic avatar and world interactions, Physics and so on.

18- C# for scripting

19- Able to multi-task like in NeosVr by switching from place to place without having to leave.

20- Stand alone client. (Important.)

21- TBA

22- Foliated rendering

More to come soon.

Age requirement: 17+

Maximum number of people per map: 20 with an overflow of 5 more people to reduce lag as much as possible. (With the exception of larger open maps.)

Hopefully Lower system requirements
